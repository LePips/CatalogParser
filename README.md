### University of Utah Catalog Course Parser

University of Utah catalog parser for course information per semester.

Was mainly created so that a REST api could be used against course lists, for any reason.

### Usage

Install requirements, then run `parser.py`.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Fill in remaining semesters
- [ ] Create `available.json` files for base which will say what campuses are available with their semester keys
